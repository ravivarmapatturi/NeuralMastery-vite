 * review schedule on top of the same mark data (see REVIEW_INTERVALS_DAYS)
 * -- a page you marked understood becomes eligible for a "due for review"
 * nudge once its current interval elapses.
 *
 * Signed-out contract (must never regress): reads/writes go straight to
 * localStorage, exactly as before Firebase existed here -- no network
 * call is made, no sign-in wall, nothing changes for a visitor who never
 * signs in.
 *
 * Signed-in contract: on the transition to signed-in, this browser's
 * current localStorage map is merged (see mergeProgress, never a silent
 * overwrite) into whatever's already in Firestore for that UID, the
 * merged result is written back, and from that point on Firestore is the
 * single source of truth -- every write goes to Firestore first, and a
 * live onSnapshot subscription is what actually updates `understood`
 * (never a direct local setState from a write), so every open tab/device
 * for that user converges on the same state. localStorage is still kept
 * mirrored while signed in purely as a fresh fallback for if/when they
 * sign out on this browser.
